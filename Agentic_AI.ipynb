    "- **phi3:mini** can *simulate* this workflow if you simplify prompts, relax parsing, and give very clear tool usage instructions.  \n",
    "- For more robust results (smoother tool calls, complex workflows), switch to a larger local model like **`llama3:8b`** or **`mistral:7b-instruct`**.  \n",
