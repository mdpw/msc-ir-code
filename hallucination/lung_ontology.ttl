:Pneumonia a :LungDisease ;
    rdfs:label "Pneumonia" ;
    rdfs:comment "Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. On a chest X-ray, it typically appears as a white or hazy area called an 'opacity' or 'consolidation', indicating fluid or pus." .

:Effusion a :LungFinding ;
    rdfs:label "Effusion" ;
    rdfs:comment "Pleural effusion is a buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. On an X-ray, it often appears as a white area, typically at the bottom of the lung, 'blunting' the sharp corner where the diaphragm meets the ribs." .

:NormalLung a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Normal Lung" ;
    rdfs:comment "A normal chest X-ray shows lungs that are clear and appear black, indicating they are filled with air. The heart shadow and diaphragm borders are sharp and well-defined. There are no signs of abnormal white areas (opacities) or fluid." .

:Atelectasis a :LungFinding ;
    rdfs:label "Atelectasis" ;
    rdfs:comment "Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a part of the lung, resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. On an X-ray, it may appear as a white, airless area or as a shift of the trachea or heart towards the collapsed area." .

:Consolidation a :LungFinding ;
    rdfs:label "Consolidation" ;
    rdfs:comment "Consolidation is a region of lung tissue that has been filled with fluid, pus, or other material, making it appear solid and white on an X-ray. It is a key sign of pneumonia." .

:Pneumothorax a :LungDisease ;
    rdfs:label "Pneumothorax" ;
    rdfs:comment "Pneumothorax is a collapsed lung, caused by air leaking into the space between the lung and the chest wall. On an X-ray, it appears as a very black area (air) with no lung markings, and a visible edge of the collapsed lung." .

:Edema a :LungFinding ;
    rdfs:label "Edema" ;
    rdfs:comment "Pulmonary edema is excess fluid in the lungs, often caused by heart failure. On X-rays, it can look like hazy, 'fluffy' opacities, often spreading from the center of the chest." .
